                    <h3>User-Oriented Collaborative Design</h3>
                    <p>Students develop detailed concepts and models of authentic new products and services. Our focus is on user-oriented, collaborative approaches to design and seeking holistic solutions integrating user and functional perspectives. We emphasize the importance of process and the development of strategies. Students observe and engage people to develop a deep understanding of their values and the patterns of their lives. They work collaboratively in a studio environment to create a shared understanding of the people they design for (and with) and the product ideas they develop. Topics covered include design thinking, ethnographic methods, concept development and interaction design.</p>
                    <p> My team project was a toy inspired by a three-toed sloth. The game we came up with was a maze of trees that 4th graders had to nagivgate with a toy sloth and collect leaves on the way to its mate. </p>
                    <h3>Mechanics of Solids & Structures</h3>
                    <p>This course covers the principles of statics of structures and mechanics of materials. The focus is on the concepts of stress and strain as related to applied loads (axial, shear, torsion, bending) and to resulting deformation. Students will learn how the principles of mechanics can be applied to mechanical design through modeling, quantitative analysis, strain gauge measurements, and computational simulation. The use of a commercial finite element package is introduced.</p>
                    <h3>Thermodynamics</h3>
                    <p>This course covers the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and physical chemistry as applied to engineering systems. This course provides a foundation in fundamental thermodynamic phenomena, including the first and second laws of thermodynamics, thermodynamic properties, equations of state in real and ideal gases, and chemical equilibrium. The basic laws are used to understand and analyze the performance and efficiency of systems, such as automobile engines, gas turbines, steam power plants, and refrigerators.</p>

                    <h3>Sculpture 1 (Wellesley Cross-Registration)</h3>
                    <p> This introduction to sculpture course taught concepts of space and form through modeling human figures and abstract shapes. Materials used included wood, clay, and plaster.</p>
                    <h3>Principles of Engineering</h3>
                    <p>Through a significant project experience, students will learn to integrate analysis, qualitative design, quantitative optimization, experiments, and simulations to improve their ability to engineer real systems. In each section of the course, students will work in small multidisciplinary teams to design and to build a mechatronic system of their own choosing. Each project must include both a nontrivial mechanical system design and a nontrivial electronic system design involving both hardware and software components. Projects will be subject to realistic materials, process, and budgetary constraints.</p>
                    <h3>Dynamics</h3>
                    <p> With an emphasis on understanding fundamental concepts, students will learn to create and analyze mathematical models for mechanical and electromechanical systems that are changing in time. Equations of motion for 3D rigid bodies and systems will be derived using conservation of momentum and energy methods. Concepts involving equilibrium, linearization, and stability will be applied to study dynamic response in both the time and frequency domains through time-integration, transfer function, and state-space analysis. The idea of feedback control is introduced. Coursework and projects will involve examples such as robots, mechanisms, vehicles, and aircraft/spacecraft.</p>
                    <h3>Linearity II</h3>
                    <p>An intradisciplinary approach that builds upon material covered in Linearity 1 to address topics in vector calculus and introductory partial differential equations. Topics include functions of more than one variable; vector-valued functions; gradient, divergence, and curl; boundaryvalue problems; and solutions to common partial differential equations. Emphasis on both numerical and analytical approaches. Note: students who have previously taken multi-variable calculus should consult with mathematics faculty to determine whether taking Linearity 2 is appropriate for their needs.</p>

                    <h3>The Entrepreneurial Initiative</h3>
                    <p>The Entrepreneurial Initiative provides an introduction to the art and science of entrepreneurial thought and action — meaning being able to succeed at times when resource constraints are the norm and the future is uncertain (which describes many of life’s most important situations). In this class, students will learn a conceptual and practical framework for taking the entrepreneurial initiative, no matter what the realm. Students expect to succeed at Olin, in graduate school, on the job, and possibly in their own venture, and this course will help them to do so by engendering a sense of what it means to be entrepreneurial. The course centers on three competencies: strategy, resourcefulness and persuasive communication. Strategy includes an understanding of, and ability to apply, both causal and effectual logic. Resourcefulness represents a talent for identifying, securing and leveraging resources through the concepts of value exchange and networks. Last but not least, persuasive communication is what enables us to influence others to support our ideas and endeavors with their contributions of time, talent, money and other resources. Mid-semester, students will have the opportunity to put your newfound knowledge and skills to the test during a multi-week, intensive challenge during which several team memebers will apply their entrepreneurial skills to effect a positive social or economic change in a real-world setting. In the final section of the course, we will touch upon entrepreneurship as a business endeavor — meaning concepts specifically relating to starting and operating a business. </p>
                    <h3>Introduction to Mechanical Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>Through project experiences, students will learn the techniques needed to both master the technical communication of mechanical designs and the fabrication skills needed to rapidly build them. Students will practice professional drafting techniques to describe a full range of fabricated components, including milled, lathed, sheet metal, water jet, injection molded, 3D printed and welded components. This course will include a significant machine shop component, where each student will gain exposure to advanced fabrication techniques. The final project will be the design and fabrication of a fully operational, complex mechanical system.</p>
                    <p>For my final group project, my team and I built an under-actuated to pick up a wide range of objects.</p>
                    <h3>Linearity I</h3>
                    <p>The fundamentals of linear algebra and differential equations are taught through the lens of discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems. Applications such as population ecology, mechanics and dynamics, circuits, networks, information processing and/or other areas relevant to engineering will be stressed.</p>
                    <h3>Mechanics Modeling and Simulation Approach</h3>
                    <p>This course provides a thorough introduction to classical mechanics. We will cover kinematics, the basis of Newton's laws, particle dynamics, the concepts of momentum, work, energy, and rotational motion, and oscillations. Additionally, the course will establish the basics of solid and fluid mechanics, concluding with introductory topics in thermodynamics. Our goal is to share with you the excitement of discovering the material universe at its most basic levels and to equip you with the basic knowledge and analytical skills necessary to become a scientist or an engineer. This course is offered in two different flavors. Course sections with a prefix of A are taught as Theoretical Mechanics. Course sections with a prefix of B are taught as Experimental Mechanics and are laboratory based.</p>
                    <h3>Real World Measurements</h3>
                    <p> Conducting experiments and making measurements is an essential aspect of all branches of science and engineering. Nearly all of our current quantitative understanding of the natural and engineered world has come from the interplay between theory and measurements. Models and simulations of systems require experimental validation and performance of engineered systems must not only be predicted, but also measured and tested. In this course we will learn the basic tools of making physical measurements and conducting experiments. We will collect data, analyze data, conduct basic error analysis, and design experimental systems. Using inexpensive modern sensors, we will build the necessary supporting electronics and learn to collect data with computer based data acquisition systems. The first part of the course will focus on individual work and students will conduct labs on basic electrical, mechanical, and environmental measurements. The later part of the course will involve a team project where measurements are made outside the controlled environment of the classroom.</p>
                    <p>My team built a working Geiger for our final project. </p>

                    <h3>Design Nature</h3>
                    <p> We take nature, an important source of inspiration and understanding, as a theme and develop bioinspired ideas into functional prototypes. Our focus is on the general principles and methods that shape the practice of engineering design. Students complete individual and team projects in a studio environment where we seek to develop a shared practice and understanding of engineering design. Students also gain experience in visualization, experimentation, estimation, fabrication, and presentation as they relate to designing. </p>

                    <h3>Modeling and Control</h3>
                    <p>A hands-on class in the modeling and control of compartment systems, including first- and secondorder thermal, mechanical, and electrical systems, the nature of effort and flow (across and through state variables) as universal concepts, power and energy, impedance, damping, passivity, qualitative feedback stability, and hysteretic, P, PI, and PID control.</p>
                    <h3>The Digital Eye: Photography, Vision, and Visual Communication</h3>
                    <p> We live in a world that is fundamentally visual and yet formal teaching and learning about visual communication is almost entirely reserved for specialists. Similarly learning about the evolution of vision and the molecular foundations of human vision are not often dealt with in introductory biology courses. This course seeks to remedy the lack of engagement with these topics at the foundational course level. In this studio-based project-oriented course students will develop an understanding of what it takes to make original art through first-hand experiences in a supportive environment. As a means to this end, students will gain facility with digital single- lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, digital photo editing and printing methods using state-of-the-art equipment. As this is an AHS foundation course students will also have an opportunity to further develop writing communication skills and critical thinking ability. The course will also address the history of photography, consider the work of a number of contemporary fine art photographers and answer the question "Why has photography changed everything?"</p>

                    <p>This course provides an introduction to mathematical modeling and computer simulation of physical systems. Working with a broad range of examples, students practice the steps involved in modeling and analyzing a physical system, learn the role of models in explaining and predicting the behavior of the physical world, and develop skills with the programming and computational tools necessary for simulation. Students work in a studio environment on increasingly open-ended projects, and learn how to present their results, with an emphasis on visual and oral communication.</p>
